\title{Randomly Sample Rows from a Spark DataFrame}
\usage{
sdf_sample(x, fraction = 1, replacement = TRUE, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object coercable to a Spark DataFrame.}

\item{fraction}{The fraction to sample.}

\item{replacement}{Boolean; sample with replacement?}

\item{seed}{An (optional) integer seed.}
}
\description{
Draw a random sample of rows (with or without replacement)
from a Spark DataFrame.

\section{Transforming Spark DataFrames}{


The family of functions prefixed with \code{sdf_} generally access the Scala
Spark DataFrame API directly, as opposed to the \code{dplyr} interface which
uses Spark SQL. These functions will 'force' any pending SQL in a
\code{dplyr} pipeline, such that the resulting \code{tbl_spark} object
returned will no longer have the attached 'lazy' SQL operations. Note that
the underlying Spark DataFrame \emph{does} execute its operations lazily, so
that even though the pending set of operations (currently) are not exposed at
the \R level, these operations will only be executed when you explicitly
\code{collect()} the table.
