\arguments{
\item{master}{Kubernetes url to connect to, found by running \code{kubectl cluster-info}.}

\item{version}{The version of Spark being used.}

\item{image}{Container image to use to launch Spark and sparklyr. Also known
as \code{spark.kubernetes.container.image}.}

\item{driver}{Name of the driver pod. If not set, the driver pod name is set
to "sparklyr" suffixed by id to avoid name conflicts. Also known as
\code{spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name}.}

\item{account}{Service account that is used when running the driver pod. The driver
pod uses this service account when requesting executor pods from the API
server. Also known as \code{spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName}.}

\item{jars}{Path to the sparklyr jars; either, a local path inside the container
image with the sparklyr jars copied when the image was created or, a path
accesible by the container where the sparklyr jars were copied. You can find
a path to the sparklyr jars by running \code{system.file("java/", package = "sparklyr")}.}

\item{forward}{Should ports used in sparklyr be forwarded automatically through Kubernetes?
Default to \code{TRUE} which runs \code{kubectl port-forward} and \code{pkill kubectl}
on disconnection.}

\item{executors}{Number of executors to request while connecting.}

\item{conf}{A named list of additional entries to add to \code{sparklyr.shell.conf}.}

\item{timeout}{Total seconds to wait before giving up on connection.}

\item{ports}{Ports to forward using kubectl.}

\item{fix_config}{Should the spark-defaults.conf get fixed? \code{TRUE} for Windows.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters, currently not in use.}
}

Convenience function to initialize a Kubernetes configuration instead
of \code{spark_config()}, exposes common properties to set in Kubernetes
clusters.
